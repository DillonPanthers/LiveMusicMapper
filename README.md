# Dillon Panther's Capstone Project

Welcome to our progressive web application: [Live Music Mapper](https://livemusicmapper.herokuapp.com/).

## Set-up

Before starting up for the first time, please run:

```
npm i
npm run start:dev
npm run seed
```

You can then run in a development environment with the `build:dev` and `start:dev` scripts. These will run webpack and nodemon, respectively, with watch flags to catch any changes.
